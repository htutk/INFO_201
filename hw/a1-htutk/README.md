# Why Apple cancelled AirPower

Since AirPower was announced in _September 2017_, Apple fans have been long-waiting to get their hands on this highly-praised wireless charging mat. After a delay of over a year, Apple has announced that they have cancelled AirPower due to **_its inability to meet the high standards set by Apple_**. At the beginning of the announcement, the critics have been pointing out the AirPower system Apple planned to develop, was indeed troublesome. Current wireless charging pad has one magnetic coil: if you have ever used one of these, you know the trouble of having to align the device on the pad perfectly to start the charging process. Apple attempted to solve this problem by converting the pad into a mat with multiple coils (_20 - 30_ at least according to the rumors). The speculated issue conveys the mat is **overheating too much to the point of damage**. 


Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering stated:

> “After much effort, we’ve concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project. We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward”
