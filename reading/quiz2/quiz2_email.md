Hello Mike,

I am trying to start Reading quiz 2. However, I can't seem to find what reading to complete to do the quiz. 
In [quiz 1](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1271664/quizzes/1117932), the instruction mentions the chapters to read.
The [quiz 2](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1271664/quizzes/1117943) does not have any instruction.

Where else can I find the info?

Thanks,
Alex Htut
