Hey Mike,

Alex here. One of the questions I asked during your OH yesterday was on my _a4 deductions_, and you told me to shoot you an email.

Michelle made this comment:
```
-3 total_pledged_unsuccessful value incorrect- after filtering, should find sum column backers then pull value
```

But I am not sure what she is referring to. I thought I calculated the value correctly. See [here](https://github.com/info201a-s19/a4-htutk/blob/master/assignment.R).

Thanks,
Alex H.
